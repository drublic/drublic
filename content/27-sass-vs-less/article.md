> “Which CSS preprocessor language should I choose?” is a hot topic lately. I’ve been asked in person several times and an online debate has been popping up every few days it seems. It’s nice that the conversation has largely turned from whether or not preprocessing is a good idea to which one language is best. Let’s do this thing.

Really short answer: SASS

> Slightly longer answer: SASS is better on a whole bunch of different fronts, but if you are already happy in LESS, that’s cool, at least you are doing yourself a favor by preprocessing.

Chris Coyier finds an answer to what preprocessor is the better one by pointing out what the advantages of each preprocessor are. And as it turns out SASS is winning the race because it has more power and better features. So if you are asked why you use SASS, you might want to link people to this post.
