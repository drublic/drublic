When I read <a href="http://blogg.antrop.se/interaktionsdesign/redesigning-the-browser-window/">this article</a> by Henrik Eneroth about redesigning Safari’s interface I thought we as webdesigners somehow do this with websites and web-apps. While Apple misses to add different behavior for different browser-sizes it’s a kind of standard to build a website with a special mobile version that looks not like the website on a desktop computer but fulfills the need of someone who visits the mobile version of the website.

In Vitaly Friedman’s (<a title="Smashing Magazine" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smasing Magazine</a>) presentation “Webdesigntrends 2011” I recognized this nice photo.

Vitaly states that someone who visits your page with a mobile device may need other information as someone who visits your page with a “normal sized” computer. That’s why I somethimes – even when I’m designing “responsive” – leave out some elements that are not really nescessary on a mobile screen, e.g. a slider with some nice-looking images.

This approche should be brought to apps, too.<br>
There are some examples where this works already. For instance there is <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder for Mac</a>, for iPad and iPhone. The desktop-app uses a similar design-pattern as Lion’s Mail for Mac: three Columns. There are more details in every next column you open.

Whatever… You should definitely visit Mr.&nbsp;Eneroth’s post on re-designing the browser-window as it is kinda important and thoughtful for everyone who has some connection to design.
