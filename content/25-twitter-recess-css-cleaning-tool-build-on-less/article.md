As I think reading the source is essential for developers to become good at what they do viewing this source in readable style is essential too. RECESS is a tool which helps you developing good-looking CSS with LESS. It is developed at Twitter and has now been open-sourced.

RECESS is a Node.js module and is maintained by <a href="https://twitter.com/fat">@fat</a>. You can find out more about it by viewing the source <a href="https://github.com/twitter/recess">at GitHub</a>.
