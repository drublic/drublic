This means the server tells the app something like &#8220;Hey look, there&#8217;s something new on your Twitter-account&#8221;. On Android this is done with push, too. It was introduced in version 2.1.0 in mid of July. Before this release they requested all Tweets via &#8220;pull&#8221;: The app asks the server &#8220;Yo server, somethin&#8217; new here?&#8221;. Draw-backs? So where&#8217;s the difference besides the obvious? with pull the app has to connect to the server in a certain time-interval",
