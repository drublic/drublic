Different projects I have worked on used Sass as the pre-compiler of their choice. This post shares some learnings we had while using Sass. There are a couple of great articles on how to use Sass in large scale projects — this one is more of a retrospective. I hope it helps you solving problems if you ever run into them.

Yesterday (17. January 2013) I was talking at TakeOff Conference in Lille, France. I actually extended my talk from the Fronteer’s Jam Session “Writing Awesome Code” with lots of new stuff. So check out the slides. There will be a video with the actual talk that is not online yet. I will post it here when it is.

Just a few words concerning the conference: The organizers are doing a great job here and the speakers are really good. If you’re not here, you are missing out on something :)
