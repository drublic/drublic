Yesterday <a href="http://kahlil.co/">Kahlil Lechelt</a> and I launched The Nitty Gritty, a new blog and resource for web developers about the cutting edge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web technology in general.

About the idea of The Nitty Gritty Kahlil writes:

> For a few years now, I’ve been watching my friends in the web development community write highly informative and well researched articles on their personal blogs, or as contributing authors writing articles for the blogs of their friends and colleagues

We met at Smashing Conference back in September this year and talked about the idea of <a href="http://thenittygritty.co/">The Nitty Gritty</a>. After some months of development we are now ready to present this idea to you.

> So, cutting a long story short, we decided to execute on the desire to create a central hub for developers, hence The Nitty Gritty (TNG) was born and now we are about to wake this beast up

I am very excited about our new project and hope so are you. I really hope that we can deliver high quality content within the next months. And hey… we already have some great articles coming up in the next few weeks

> […] including the performance pope Schepp, Yeoman core contributor Sindre Sorhus, and the maker of Kirby, Bastian Allgeier

I have written a post myself about decoupling CSS by using placeholders in Sass which will be published today.

We would be pleased if you let us know what you think about this idea on Twitter. And make sure you follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_thenittygritty">@_thenittygritty</a>! :)
