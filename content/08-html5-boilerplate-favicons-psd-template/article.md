### Version 3.0 – Update 25.05.2012

And again <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dnlhtz">Daniel</a> updated the template with some great things.<br>
It now features the <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/commit/e2fff6fe07c6a82bf36f648de4cbe27f9544af7d">“new” HTML5 Boilerplate icons</a>, you get a better overview of what icons are present and how the output of images is.<br>
Apart from that Daniel made a bug-fix for the 144×144px touch icon where the PNG wasn’t saved by default.

### Version 2.0 – Update 21.03.2012

Daniel has updated the favicon template with a 144×144px touch icon. This icon is needed for the high-resolution iPad Retina displays which are built into the latest version of the iPad. A version of this is also included in HTML5 Boilerplate by default. Please read <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1020">this issue</a> for more information and remember <a title="Mathias Bynens on touch icons" href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons">Mathias’ article</a>, which he updated recently.

Thanks goes out to Daniel.

I’m using <a title="HTML5 Boilerplate - A rock-solid default for HTML5 awesome" href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>&nbsp;(H5BP) for nearly all of my projects at the moment. Why? Mh, I think mostly because it provides best practice for so many things concerning front-end development. With H5BP I learned <a title="Mathias Bynens on touch icons" href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons">how to use favicons</a>&nbsp;(or touch icons) in different variations for smartphones and stuff properly.

Friend and boss <a title="dnlhtz.de" href="http://dnlhtz.de/">Daniel</a>&nbsp;designed a nice PSD template to create the various icons you need. It has four different sizes and includes slices and meta-information for everything. You just need to include your favicon, “Save for Web” and you’re done.

He gives it away for free. So feel free to download and share. It would be pretty nice if you check out <a title="Daniel on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/dnlhtz">his Twitter-stream</a> and follow him.

### Additions

Please be aware that you also should add an&nbsp;<code>apple-touch-icon.png</code>. You could do this by copying <code>apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png</code> and rename this. Thanks <a title="maddesigns - Certified TYPO3 Integrator, Freelancer für Webentwicklung mit CSS3" href="http://maddesigns.de/">Sven</a> for the heads up.
<h4>A Note on .ico</h4>

Since you should always use a .ico file for the favicon in order to get it working in Internet Explorer I would advice you to open favicon.png in Photoshop and use <a href="http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/product/ICOFormat#icoformat">the ICOFormat plugin</a> to generate the .ico file.
<h4>Multi-Layer Favicons</h4>

<a href="http://www.randomprecision.co.uk/">Jon R. Humphrey</a> made a layered favicon template and <a href="https://github.com/jonrandahl/H5BP-Multi-Layer-FavIcons/">shared it on GitHub</a>. Please check it out, it might be more helpful than this template from time to time.
