Every manager's ultimate task is to build successful teams. In my career, it has become apparent to me that as a manager, you have to monitor your teams closely in order to reach that goal. This will enable you as a manager to discover when a team is overwhelmed with their work.

There are several reasons why engineering teams may become overwhelmed:

__Insufficient staffing:__ If the team is understaffed relative to the amount of work they are expected to complete, they may become overwhelmed.

__Unclear or unrealistic expectations:__ If the team's goals and objectives are not clearly defined, or if they are given unrealistic deadlines, they may become overwhelmed.

__Poor time management:__ If team members are not effectively managing their time and prioritizing tasks, they may become overwhelmed.

__Lack of resources:__ If the team does not have the necessary resources, such as adequate hardware, software, or support from other teams, they may become overwhelmed.

__Complex projects:__ If the team is working on complex projects with many dependencies and moving parts, they may become overwhelmed.

It's important to identify the root cause of why a team becomes overwhelmed and address it in a timely manner to prevent burnout and maintain team productivity.

There are solutions for all of these points, let's focus on staffing.

## Add Additional Developers to an Engineering Team

There are a few key factors to consider when deciding whether to add additional people to an engineering team:

**Workload:** If the team is consistently overwhelmed with work and struggling to meet deadlines, it may be time to consider adding additional team members.

**Specialization:** If the team needs expertise in a specific area or technology, adding a team member with those skills can be beneficial.

**Growth:** If the company is experiencing rapid growth and the engineering team needs to keep up with demand, adding additional team members may be necessary.

**Turnover:** If the team has high turnover or is losing key team members, adding additional team members can help fill the gap and maintain team productivity.

It's important to carefully consider the cost and benefits of adding additional team members, as well as the impact on team dynamics. In some cases, it may be more effective to reorganize the team or hire contractors to address specific needs rather than adding permanent team members.

## How to Build a Successful Engineering Team

Building the best engineering teams requires a combination of effective management and good hiring practices. Here are some tips for building a strong engineering team:

1. Define the team's goals and objectives: Clearly define the team's goals and objectives, and make sure that all team members understand and are aligned with them. This will help the team stay focused and motivated.

2. Hire the right people: Look for candidates who have the skills, experience, and personality to fit in with the team. Consider diversity in terms of background, perspective, and skills when hiring.

3. Foster a positive work culture: Create an environment that is inclusive, collaborative, and supportive. Encourage open communication and teamwork, and recognize and reward good work. Build an open feedback culture.

4. Provide training and development opportunities: Invest in the development of your team members by providing training, mentorship, and professional development opportunities. This will help individuals grow and improve their skills, which will benefit the team as a whole - and thus ultimately the organization.

5. Set clear expectations and guidelines: Establish clear expectations and guidelines for the team, including responsibilities, deadlines, and performance standards. This will help team members understand what is expected of them and how to meet those expectations.

6. Communicate regularly: Regular, open communication is key to the success of any team - be transparent. Hold regular team meetings, and encourage team members to share ideas and discuss any issues or challenges they are facing.

7. Be flexible and adaptable: Be open to change and new ideas, and be willing to adapt your team's approach as needed. This will help your team stay agile and respond to changing circumstances.
