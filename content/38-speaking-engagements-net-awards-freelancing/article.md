## Talking at Conferences

As you know, if you follow along my stuff, I spoke about coding guidelines at TalkOff Conference in Lille, France in January this year. The conference was organized very well and I had a lot of fun. Besides that I met a lot of great people. Thanks again for the invitation. You can <a href="https://www.hansreinl.de/archive/takeoff-conference-talking-about-good-code/">find the slides here</a>.

I am also very happy to be invited to <a href="http://www.uxmunich.com/">UX Munich</a> where I will speak about style guides in general and how you can be friends with designers. Check out <a href="http://www.uxmunich.com/speakers/hans-christian-reinl">the talk’s description</a> on their website. There are a lot great people speaking at the conference as for example Vitaly Friedmann from <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> and <a href="http://rainypixels.com/">Nishant Kothary</a> who was part of the team that redesigned <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft.com</a>. Also <a href="http://bastianallgeier.com/">Bastian Allgeier</a> will be speaking, who <a href="http://thenittygritty.co/the-future-of-the-web-a-draft">wrote an article for The Nitty Gritty</a> just recently.<br>
This conference will take place in Munich, Germany and will be helt next week. So check it out quickly and <a href="http://uxmunich.com/register">get a ticket</a>!

Later in April I will present at <a href="http://2013.front-trends.com/">Front-Trends 2013</a> in Warsaw in Poland and yet again some top speakers of our industry will present there, too. Check out <a href="http://2013.front-trends.com/speakers/">the speakers page</a> to find Lea Verou, Faruk Ateş, Jake Archibald and a lot of others.

If you want me to speak at your conference, I’d be happy to submit a proposal. Just <a href="https://www.hansreinl.de/#contact">contact me</a>.

## .net-Awards Nomination

I am very happy to be one of the nominees of this year’s .net-Awards in the category “Young Developer of the Year”. Check out <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">the website</a> and vote what you like.<br>
Thanks to everyone who proposed me to be nominated, this really means a lot to me. &lt;3


## Freelance Work

A couple of months ago I decided to leave <a href="http://gebruederheitz.de/">/gebrüderheitz</a> and do freelance work exclusively for some time starting in April. I want to focus a bit more on Open Source projects and work on some side-projects. I am really excited about the projects that I’ll be working on and about the re-organisation of my life.<br>
The pipeline of actual client projects is still kind of free, so drop me a mail to <a href="mailto:info@drublic.de">info@drublic.de</a> or use the <a href="https://www.hansreinl.de/#contact">contact form</a> if you are interested in working with me. Please see the <a href="https://www.hansreinl.de/#hire-me">“Hire me” section</a> on my website to get a quick overview of what I like to work on.

This all and some projects besides my normal work schedule keep me from updating my blog more often. I hope to write some more technical articles soon.<br>
LOVE!
