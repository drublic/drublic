  "abstract": "<p>I want to share my experience of transitioning from an individual contributor role to a management position in my engineering career. Although I know that the management track is distinct from that of an individual contributor, I realized that it is a common path for career growth in many organizations. The journey was filled with both challenges and rewards, and I learned the importance of developing new skills and adapting to new responsibilities as a manager. It was not an easy transition, but I embraced the opportunity to lead my team and contribute to the success of the organization. I hope that my experience can inspire others to take on new challenges and strive for growth in their own careers.</p>",
