It’s been over two years now – with our podcast Working Draft we have done 100 revisions. Congratulations to ourselves!

We recorded revision 100 on Monday and had a very special guest: Paul Irish. That’s why we recorded in English this time. The <a href="http://workingdraft.de/100/">final podcast</a> is now live and can be downloaded. Check it out and let us know what you think.</p>
