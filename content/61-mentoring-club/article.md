The Mentoring Club is an open community which aims at supporting people who are keen to learn, grow and develop. Mentees can expect advice, which is based on year long experiences. Our mentors are open, give honest and direct feedback and, of course, guarantee full discretion.

I hope I can help others to advance in their career by sharing my knowledge in the areas of Engineering, Engineering Management & Leadership, Agile Methodologies and more.
