Since I’m using SASS (in its dialect SCSS) and have some other things I define over and over again I decided to set up a package that lets me start easily and includes a lot of tools that are necessary for my projects.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<p>This is an introduction to <a href="https://github.com/drublic/init"><em>init</em></a>, the starting point for projects that require a bit more than just HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>

<h2>Not just HTML5 Boilerplate …</h2>
<p>With HTML5 Boilerplate we are creating an awesome starting point for front-end developers that want to use a solid boilerplate that has defaults that are useful for everyone. Besides that we want to keep it simple and straightforward. That’s why adding a preprocessor or complex dependencies to HTML5 Boilerplate is not possible.</p>
<p>For the team I’m working with at <a href="http://gebruederheitz.de/">/gebrüderheitz</a> and me it’s important to have a solid basis for projects we do that we can use over and over again. Other developers have this need too and that’s why there is <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> or <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">ZURB’s Foundation</a> (just to name two) out there.<br />
Just while developing this project my buddy <a href="http://kahlil.co/">Kahlil</a> came up with a nearly similar approach: <a href="https://github.com/kahlil/h5bponcrack">HTML5 Boilerplate on Crack</a>. He has different things in his package then <em>init</em> has. Keep an eye on that.</p>
<h2>Simplify Development</h2>
<p>For <em>init</em> I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">Grunt.js</a> as a development- and deployment-tool. Grunt is a Node.js based task-oriented tool that simplifies developing and deploying JavaScript a lot. Since Grunt has a big and valuable community there are a lot of plugins that you can use with it to help developing HTML and CSS too.<br />
Currently <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1140">we are thinking about including Grunt into HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, which is a great step in moving the project to the next stage.</p>
<p>As stated before I love using SASS as a preprocessor and I have some structure I like to apply to my SCSS-development files which I already outlined in my post about <a href="http://drublic.de/blog/my-coding-style-and-guidelines/">my personal coding guidelines</a>. This requires to have Ruby installed on your local machine to compile SCSS into a CSS-file or to use a tool like <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> that does everything for you. I am actually a big fan of CodeKit but also like to have the compilation as part of my whole build process for a website.</p>
<p>SCSS compilation is integrated in <em>init’s</em> Gruntfile.<br />
By running <code>grunt watch</code> you start a process which watches for changes in your SCSS-files and compiles the CSS-file automatically unsing <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus">Sindre Sorhus’</a> awesome Grunt-plugin <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass">grunt-sass</a>. Besides that the <code>watch</code>-task recognizes changes in your JavaScript files and lints them on the fly.</p>
<p>If you’re not dependent on any special server-environment you can easily fire up <code>./server.sh</code> on your console to start a small Ruby-server with a tab in your favorite browser.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other goodies in the project. Please visit GitHub and <a href="https://github.com/drublic/init#readme">read the project’s readme-file</a> for more information.</p>
<p>I’d also encourage everyone to keep an eye on <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> since I think it can do a lot more then my package does and will be awesome. It will be available soon.</p>
<h2>It’s Open Source</h2>
<p>This project is Open Source and I would love to see some people chiming in and <a href="https://github.com/drublic/init/issues">discussing the project</a> in its current state to make it better. I’d love to get some feedback from all of you!</p>
<p>Apart from that please feel free to use it for your projects. It’s all under MIT License and thus pretty much there for all your needs.</p>
<p>Thanks for being awesome, community </p>
