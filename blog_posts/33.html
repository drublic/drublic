		<p><strong>Version 3.1 – Update 25.11.2012</strong><br />
Add current 16x16px favicon.</p>
<h3>Version 3.0 – Update 25.05.2012</h3>
<p>And again <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dnlhtz">Daniel</a> updated the template with some great things.<br />
It now features the <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/commit/e2fff6fe07c6a82bf36f648de4cbe27f9544af7d">“new” HTML5 Boilerplate icons</a>, you get a better overview of what icons are present and how the output of images is.<br />
Apart from that Daniel made a bug-fix for the 144×144px touch icon where the PNG wasn’t saved by default.</p>

<h3>Version 2.0 – Update 21.03.2012</h3>
<p>Daniel has updated the favicon template with a 144×144px touch icon. This icon is needed for the high-resolution iPad Retina displays which are built into the latest version of the iPad. A version of this is also included in HTML5 Boilerplate by default. Please read <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1020">this issue</a> for more information and remember <a title="Mathias Bynens on touch icons" href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons">Mathias’ article</a>, which he updated recently.</p>
<p>Thanks goes out to Daniel.</p>

<p>I’m using <a title="HTML5 Boilerplate - A rock-solid default for HTML5 awesome" href="http://html5boilerplate.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>&nbsp;(H5BP) for nearly all of my projects at the moment. Why? Mh, I think mostly because it provides best practice for so many things concerning front-end development. With H5BP I learned <a title="Mathias Bynens on touch icons" href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons">how to use favicons</a>&nbsp;(or touch icons) in different variations for smartphones and stuff properly.</p>
<p>Friend and boss <a title="dnlhtz.de" href="http://dnlhtz.de/">Daniel</a>&nbsp;designed a nice PSD template to create the various icons you need. It has four different sizes and includes slices and meta-information for everything. You just need to include your favicon, “Save for Web” and you’re done.</p>
<p>He gives it away for free. So feel free to download and share. It would be pretty nice if you check out <a title="Daniel on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/dnlhtz">his Twitter-stream</a> and follow him.</p>

<h3>Additions</h3>
<p>Please be aware that you also should add an&nbsp;<code>apple-touch-icon.png</code>. You could do this by copying <code>apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png</code> and rename this. Thanks <a title="maddesigns - Certified TYPO3 Integrator, Freelancer für Webentwicklung mit CSS3" href="http://maddesigns.de/">Sven</a> for the heads up.</p>
<h4>A Note on .ico</h4>
<p>Since you should always use a .ico file for the favicon in order to get it working in Internet Explorer I would advice you to open favicon.png in Photoshop and use <a href="http://www.telegraphics.com.au/sw/product/ICOFormat#icoformat">the ICOFormat plugin</a> to generate the .ico file.</p>
<h4>Multi-Layer Favicons</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.randomprecision.co.uk/">Jon R. Humphrey</a> made a layered favicon template and <a href="https://github.com/jonrandahl/H5BP-Multi-Layer-FavIcons/">shared it on GitHub</a>. Please check it out, it might be more helpful than this template from time to time.</p>
