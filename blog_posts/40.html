				<h3>Hey there…</h3>
				<p>This post is 681 days old. It was written on 15.08.2011. Please make sure to be careful with the information provided and check a more recent source on this topic.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I need some space to share my thoughts. Sometimes this means its just a very short post and sometimes it will be a little bit more. Some kind of tutorial or what ever.</p>
<p>Actually I’m a front-end developer located in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiburg_im_Breisgau" target="_blank">Freiburg</a>, Germany. Maybe you’ve head of this city: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a> is based here, too.<br />
I’m currently working as a freelancer at <a href="http://gebruederheitz.de/" target="_blank">/gebrüderheitz</a> with people like <a href="http://dnlhtz.de/" target="_blank">Daniel</a> and <a href="http://www.t3node.com/" target="_blank">Steffen</a>. I’m also engaged in some projects: I do some fancy stuff with <a href="http://christianschlack.de/" target="_blank">Christian</a> (we do <a href="http://pagetimer.de/" target="_blank">Pagetimer</a>), with Daniel I’m developing WordPress-Themes for <a href="http://themeforest.net/?ref=Flipthemes" target="_blank">Themeforest</a> under the name <a href="http://flipthemes.de/" target="_blank">Flipthemes</a> (you should checkout <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/genova-minimalistic-wordpress-template/107133?ref=Flipthemes" target="_blank">this theme</a>) and there is this kinda new project <a href="http://smart-students.de/" target="_blank">Smart-Students</a> with some other guys. Go check it out if you want to.</p>
<p>So, most of the time I’m developing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I really like all the HTML5 and CSS3 goodness and try to code “cutting edge”. Sometimes this is not possible in regard to the customers need. But anyway…<br />
My favorite JS library is (as I think you can guess) <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and I try to stay up to date with all the new stuff they’re bringing in with every minor release. You should definitely <a href="http://blog.jquery.com/" target="_blank">read their blog</a> to get to know the latest news.<br />
Furthermore I really do a lot of stuff with WordPress and TYPO3.</p>
<p>There are some other things I’m doing. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/drublic" target="_blank">Github-Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to write something.</p>
