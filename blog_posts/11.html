		<p><strong>HTML5 Boilerplate is out with the new version 4.0.0.</strong></p>
<p>There were some significant changes since the last version that are listed up <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">in the changelog</a> (also see below). Most of them because of the excellent work by <a href="http://twitter.com/necolas">Nicolas Gallagher</a> – thanks for leading HTML5 Boilerplate with such great effort.</p>

<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<p>This was done throughout the last seven months of development and resolving bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add documentation in a separate folder – everything that is directly concerned with the project was moved from the wiki
<li>Switch from Public Domain to MIT license
<li>Separate Normalize.css from the rest of the CSS
<li>Improve console.log protection
<li>Replace <strong>hot pink</strong> text selection color with a neutral color
<li>Nicolas introduced a better image replacement technique
<li>Code format and consistency changes (</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>

<p>Sadly we <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1140">could not integrate Grunt.js</a> into the project with some simple tasks because we had to face certain problems when it comes to integrate the CSS file that is build by Grunt into the repository and other impediments.</p>
<p>Now HTML5 Boilerplate 4.0.0 is out and I’d encourage you to view the source, learn and <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate">contribute</a>.<br />
If you find bugs or potential pitfalls please let us know in the <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues">issues</a>.<br />
Cheers to the <a href="http://h5bp.github.com/">H5BP community</a> and especially <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/graphs/contributors">all HTML5 Boilerplate contributors</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from HTML5 Boilerplate <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_gibson">Alex Gibson</a>, Nicolas and <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/mobile-boilerplate/graphs/contributors">others</a> updated Mobile Boilerplate to version 4.0.0, so go and check it out too!</p>
<p>And another thing: Both <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/mobile">Mobile Boilerplate</a> have a new website which looks kinda awesome, I think!</p>
