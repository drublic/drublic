<p>When I read <a href="http://blogg.antrop.se/interaktionsdesign/redesigning-the-browser-window/">this article</a> by Henrik Eneroth about redesigning Safari’s interface I thought we as webdesigners somehow do this with websites and web-apps. While Apple misses to add different behavior for different browser-sizes it’s a kind of standard to build a website with a special mobile version that looks not like the website on a desktop computer but fulfills the need of someone who visits the mobile version of the website.</p>
<div id="attachment_148" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 410px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-148     " title="Responsive version vs. stand-alone mobile specific website" src="http://drublic.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Bildschirmfoto-2011-08-13-um-14.34.50.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="371" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The difference between a responsive mobile optimized website on the left and a stand-alone mobile version</p></div>
<p>In Vitaly Friedman’s (<a title="Smashing Magazine" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Smasing Magazine</a>) presentation “Webdesigntrends 2011″ I recognized this nice photo.</p>
<p>Vitaly states that someone who visits your page with a mobile device may need other information as someone who visits your page with a “normal sized” computer. That’s why I somethimes – even when I’m designing “responsive” – leave out some elements that are not really nescessary on a mobile screen, e.g. a slider with some nice-looking images.</p>
<p>This approche should be brought to apps, too.<br />
There are some examples where this works already. For instance there is <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder for Mac</a>, for iPad and iPhone. The desktop-app uses a similar design-pattern as Lion’s Mail for Mac: three Columns. There are more details in every next column you open.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-161" title="Reeder for Mac" src="http://drublic.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Bildschirmfoto-2011-08-13-um-14.48.29-600x380.png" alt="" width="600" height="380" /></p>
<p>Whatever… You should definitely visit Mr.&nbsp;Eneroth’s post on re-designing the browser-window as it is kinda important and thoughtful for everyone who has some connection to design.</p>
