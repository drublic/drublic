  "readme": "# CSS Modals [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/drublic/css-modal.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/drublic/css-modal)\n\nModals built out of pure CSS\n\nPlease [visit the website](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal) to read more about this project.\n\n## What is it\n\n__Built with pure CSS:__ CSS Modal is built out of pure CSS. JavaScript is only for sugar. This makes\nthem perfectly accessible.\n\n__Optimized for mobile:__ The modals are designed using responsive web design methods. They work on all\nscreen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high resolution screens.\n\n__Use as Sass plugin:__ You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) plugin and apply it to\nyour custom classes. No need to understand all the code.\n\n__A few other advantages:__ accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and fast!\n\n\n## How to use\n\nPlease visit [the website's section](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#howto-markup)\non how to use the CSS Modal.\n\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. This does not include\nInternet Explorer 7 or lower.\n\n\n## Heads up\n\nPlease be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after\nhiding the modal.\n\nThere is an event that is fired on the modal itself after the modal is show\nwhich is called `cssmodal:show` and an event after the modal is hidden called\n`cssmodal:hide`.\n\nThere events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or\nsomething else to create custom events.\n\n\n## Bug reports and feature requests\n\nIf you got something that's worth including into the project please\n[open an issue](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues) for further\ndiscussion.\n\nPlease see the [section on contributing](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#contributing)\non the website.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis is a project by [Hans Christian Reinl](http://drublic.de). Thanks goes out\nto [all other contributors](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/contributors).\n",
