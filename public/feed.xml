  <description><![CDATA[<p>When I was working in a small agency, years ago, in Germany's warmest city, Freiburg, my boss introduced the team to agile working methods that he had read a book about. We had a whiteboard with some columns on them named To Do, Doing, Done. Some stickies were on these columns. We had a fast-lane which was filled with tasks all the time. I felt I was doing quite some work when fulfilling the tasks and moving a pile of them from one column to the next. Anyway, projects didn't finish on time. The feeling of being productive vanished as soon as we felt we were delivering late. Was there a problem in productivity?</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>We tend to solve a lot of problems related to the front-end by delegating them to existing programs. We use libraries and tools which we don’t understand completely - our code base grows and grows. But lately this trend seems to change and we slowly re-consider what we can do best: develop front-end code. What can we expect from this new trend and how can we use them in out daily business today?</p>]]></description>

It provides a <code>script</code> object in a project’s <code>package.json</code> configuration which can hold several CLI scripts. It is possible to run those via your command line. This way it is possible to replace your current build system. This article covers more about how you replace different tasks of a typical front-end build workflow.</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>tl;dr: It&#8217;s necessary to keep the focus within a dialog while tabbing through it. The function below is the easiest way to implement this behavior in JavaScript. When I created CSS Modal I wanted it to be accessible for screen readers and people that only use the keyboard for navigation. Nicholas Zakas has a great post that helped me a lot with making CSS Modal accessible without too much work. This posts explains a bit about aria roles, how to use tabindex and how you set focus to the element initially and bringing it back where it was before when</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>In the last couple of months I&#8217;ve worked on several projects that needed an overlay with some content on it. Some front-end frameworks as for example Bootstrap refer to them as modals. You can find a lot of implementations that do exactly what I search for but they all have one major drawback: They rely on JavaScript. Yes, sure, everyone has JavaScript enabled these days but why use a technique that you don&#8217;t necessarily need for a given problem? Also most implementations have drawbacks when it comes to mobile devices and responsive web design in general or accessibility. Apart from</p>]]></description>

We know of the em unit which is relative to the font-size of the parent element it is defined on. This means if one of the parents in the DOM-tree changes its font-size, the font-size of the child element changes too. In contrast the rem unit is</p>]]></description>

This is an introduction to init, the starting point for projects that require a bit more than just HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>]]></description>

It&#8217;s nice that the conversation has largely turned from whether or not preprocessing is a good idea to which one language is best. Let&#8217;s do this thing. Really short answer: SASS Slightly longer answer: SASS is better on a whole bunch of different fronts, but if you are already happy in LESS, that&#8217;s cool, at least you are doing yourself a favor by preprocessing.

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>Since the beginning of February there were some proposals for the CSS3 specification. These proposals are not yet part of the specification and will likely be changed until they get adopted by the CSSWG. One of these drafts is the CSS Hierarchies Module Level 3. So what&#8217;s the Hierarchies Module? And why &#8220;Level 3&#8243;? The Hierarchies Module is not exactly new. It exists since the very first steps of CSS and was first released in Dezember 1996 with CSS1. The CSS1 specification is still up, so check it out if you want to. When you write CSS you always use selectors to target</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>I think all of you know Lea Verou&#8217;s dabblet. dabblet is an interactive playground for quickly testing snippets of CSS and HTML code. It uses -prefix-free, so that you won&#8217;t have to add any prefixes in your CSS code. You can save your work in Github gists, embed it in other websites and share it with others. ~ About dabblet Some time ago I made this tiny Google Chrome App for jsFiddle which is in case just a bookmarklet with a bigger icon. I did this for dabblet, too but extended the app to something more: It displays all your dabblets</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>At /gebrüderheitz we use Git as a version control system as we think this is the best to work together on a level which is easy to learn and work with. Before we used Git we’ve used SVN but this is by far not as flexible as Git. There are enough posts gathering the difference between Git and SVN so I will not cover any of these. When working in a team it’s important to keep your different stages of development in sync and control somehow: There is a front-end development going on which is in deep connection with the</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>Some weeks ago I made a pull request for HTML5Boilerplate which should update jQuery to the latest version available on the Google CDN. How ever I copied the old version of minified jQuery because the uncompressed version was available but the minified wasn&#8217;t. Stupid thing! That&#8217;s why I created Is Mothereffin&#8217; jQuery up? The service checks three major CDNs for the availability of the latest jQuery version. View Is Mothereffin&#8217; jQuery up?

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>There is a big discussion going on at the moment covering the actual point of how to deal with images and media et al. on mobile-phones and other devices as there are some things that don&#8217;t work as on a desktop computer: Bandwidth Screen size Performance / Velocity The question is how to deliver responsive images on a mobile website. You maybe use something like img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; } in your responsive design to prevent images from being bigger then the screen of a mobile device. In most of the cases this shrinks images in its displayed</p>]]></description>

  <link>https://drublic.de/blog/how-to-build-accordion-using-css-and-jquery/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>We&#8217;re doing a project these days where we use an accordion-menu to show some content. I want to share with you how I did this using jQuery and CSS. This is pretty easy and I want to encourage you not to use any plugin or so but to write the code yourself and learn a bit more about how to use CSS and jQuery and save some microseconds on your loading type. The HTML This is kinda straightforward I think. We don&#8217;t need a wrapper for the accordion-menu. Check it: &lt;section id=&quot;experts&quot; class=&quot;accordion-item&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#experts&quot;&gt;Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/section&gt; This is</p>]]></description>

  <title>Resize Elements with CSS3</title>
  <link>https://drublic.de/blog/restrict-textareas-resize-css3/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>The CSS3-spec is full of wonderful things. Sometimes things that are not so desperately needed as others but anyway… good to have them. One of these more or less needed properties might be resize. It is part of the CSS3 Basic User Interface Module. What is really useful with resize is the ability to restrict the resizing of textarea for example. But it is possible to resize every element you&#8217;d like to as this demo by Simurai shows. There are four values for resize that are kinda logical: none: no resizing at all horizontal: resizing only horizontal vertical: resizing only…</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>With CSS3 be get some great new functions to use that are now accessible pretty easy. These are not only rounded corners or shadows but also transitions and full animations that let you do things that were only possible with JavaScript some time ago. In the footer of this website I use CSS3 3D-transitions for rotating two images. There is a front- and a back-site for that image. Through animation on click it looks like these images are rotating. I&#8217;m not the first one using this technique. I got inspired by Google+. They are using it for rotation of the</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>Sven asked me some stuff about the HTML5 Boilerplate Favicon PSD-Template while he was using it for a project. He discovered one problem I was not aware of and I don&#8217;t know how to work around: Android does not use one of the apple-touch-icons as a bookmark or as a shortcut on the home-screen in Android 2.3. I do not know of any other usage of the icons in prior versions of Android. But this article by Rob Flaherty stats that it is working for Android 2.1 and 2.2 with some minor changes. He also set up this demo-page. Feel free</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>This mothereffin shit is worth a blog-post. Even if it&#8217;s just a short one. At this very moment I&#8217;m celebrating the fact that Internet Explorer 10 now supports text-shadows kinda excessively! Finally! Even Internet Explorer made it! Yayyyy! For more details on this, please go and check out the Internet Explorer 10 Guide for Developers. Microsoft developers explain the usage of text-shadow here. But I guess it should be pretty clear how to use them as other browsers support them like forever. Thanks goes out to Louis Lazaris for his tweet about it. Also @IE tweeted about this.

  <title>Add Style-Syntax in Comments with `, _ and *</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>You may be familiar with the syntax of writing code-Tags like <code>some code here</code>. This is what is used by Github for example. At Daring Fireball they wrote up the syntax. Not only for code-Tags but for various features that are connected to style and semantics. In the comments of this blog it is possible to use some of the rules to add some markup to them. For instance when you write: Some fancy text with <strong>styled <em>markup</em></strong> and <code>code</code>. It will be transfered to Some fancy text with &lt;strong&gt;styled &lt;em&gt;markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;code&gt;code&lt;/code&gt;. I really like to use these tags</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>So the spec introduces a new attribute on a-tags (so called &#8220;links&#8221; &#8211; this may be new to you ;-)) called download (short: a@download &#8211; this technique of connecting attributes with tags is written up and documented by Mathias Bynens). When you link to a file like an image or a PDF-document it will be displayed within the browser normally. The download-attribute in links prevents this behavior and offers the file as a download in your browser. Definition The spec allows the attribute for having a value. This value can be a string which defines the name of the downloaded file. As a default</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>When I read this article by Henrik Eneroth about redesigning Safari&#8217;s interface I thought we as webdesigners somehow do this with websites and web-apps. While Apple misses to add different behavior for different browser-sizes it&#8217;s a kind of standard to build a website with a special mobile version that looks not like the website on a desktop computer but fulfills the need of someone who visits the mobile version of the website. In Vitaly Friedman&#8217;s (Smasing Magazine) presentation &#8220;Webdesigntrends 2011&#8243; I recognized this nice photo.

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>In browsers we do not have the ability to automatically hyphenate continuous text. This is an issue when you are using text-align: justify; for instance because the text may look really bad. I want to write about this topic because of the discussion that came up at the HTML5 Boilerpates issue-list and this blogpost at Fontdeck Blog. The specification says: Hyphenation means splitting words to improve the layout of paragraphs. CSS3 Properties CSS3 adds six properties to the list of useful thing. These are: The most important one is hyphens. More to this one later. You can add dictionary-files with hyphenate-resource</p>]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[<p><p>You do know the nice message which is submitted to your smartphone when someone mentions you on Twitter? iOS gets these messages via push. This means the server tells the app something like &#8220;Hey look, there&#8217;s something new on your Twitter-account&#8221;. On Android this is done with push, too. It was introduced in version 2.1.0 in mid of July. Before this release they requested all Tweets via &#8220;pull&#8221;: The app asks the server &#8220;Yo server, somethin&#8217; new here?&#8221;.
