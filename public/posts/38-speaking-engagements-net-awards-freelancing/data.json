Talking at Conferences As you know, if you follow along my stuff, I spoke about coding guidelines at TalkOff Conference in Lille, France in January this year. The conference was organized very well and I had a lot of fun. Besides that I met a lot of great people. Thanks again for the invitation. You can find the slides here. I am also very happy to be invited to UX Munich where I will speak about style guides",
