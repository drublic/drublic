		<p>In the last couple of months I’ve worked on several projects that needed an overlay with some content on it. Some front-end frameworks as for example <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> refer to them as <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals">modals</a>.<br />
You can find a lot of implementations that do exactly what I search for but they all have one major drawback: They rely on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Yes, sure, everyone has JavaScript enabled these days but why use a technique that you don’t necessarily need for a given problem? Also most implementations have drawbacks when it comes to mobile devices and responsive web design in general or accessibility. Apart from that they add a lot of code, that is not necessary for a lot of pages. Others might add dependencies such as for example jQuery which you don’t need at all on your micro-site.</p>
<p>To tackle these problems I decided to write my own implementation of a modal that fulfills what I need.</p>
<h2>Modals built out of pure CSS</h2>
<p><a href="http://drublic.github.io/css-modal">CSS Modal</a> is the result of this experiment.</p>
<p>Here is what is cool about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS Modal is built out of pure CSS while JavaScript is only for some sugar.</li>
<li>The modals are designed using responsive web design methods.</li>
<li>It is accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and fast!</li>
</ul>
<p>Another cool thing is that you can use CSS Modal as Sass plugin and apply it to your custom classes using Sass placeholders.</p>
