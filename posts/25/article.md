		<p><a title="Lea Verou | Life at the bleeding edge (of web standards)" href="http://leaverou.me/" target="_blank">Lea Verou</a> publishes some really great stuff. Her latest work is <a title="Animatable: One property, two values, endless possiblities" href="http://leaverou.github.com/animatable" target="_blank">Animatable</a>. A tool to showcase the variety of things you can do with CSS3 animations. And it’s awesome.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I had this article about <a title="CSS3: Rotate Images on Click" href="http://drublic.de/blog/css3-rotate-images-on-click/" target="_blank">rotating images</a> like I use in the footer of this page. <a title="transform - from perspective(400) rotateY(0deg) to perspective(400) rotateY(360deg)" href="http://leaverou.github.com/animatable/#transform/5" target="_blank">There is an animation</a> in Lea’s demos that makes use of the same properties.</p>
<p>You will find some nice cutting edge CSS3-techniques in the demos so make sure to check out the <a title="Animatable on GitHub" href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/animatable" target="_blank">source-code on GitHub</a>. You can also contribute and check in a pull request if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: And by the way… Lea <a title="Animatable: A CSS transitions gallery" href="http://leaverou.me/2011/10/animatable-a-css-transitions-gallery/" target="_blank">writes about her idea</a> :)</p>
