		<p>Some weeks ago Paul Irish published his <a title="Tiered, Adaptive Front-end Experiences" href="http://paulirish.com/2011/tiered-adaptive-front-end-experiences/" target="_blank">article about TAFEE</a> (Tiered, Adaptive Front-end Experiences)&nbsp;and shares Paul Boag’s booklet called “Where are my rounded corners?” which tries to describe why it is better to design for the future and modern browsers and not spending too much time trying to get the website’s design working in older browsers (namely Internet Explorer 7 and 8).</p>
<p>The booklet was originally published in Paul Boag’s blog. Paul describes why he did this this:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the biggest areas of confusion among our clients is progressive enhancement. They wonder why the beautiful design they signed off doesn’t look the same in older browsers. To overcome this problem we are making two changes. First, we are trying wherever possible to show them designs in the browser rather than as static images. Second, I have put together a short document outlining why progressive enhancement is ultimately better for their site.</p>
