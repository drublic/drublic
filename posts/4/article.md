		<p>Yesterday (17. January 2013) I was talking at TakeOff Conference in Lille, France. I actually extended my talk from the Fronteer’s Jam Session “Writing Awesome Code” with lots of new stuff. So check out the slides. There will be a video with the actual talk that is not online yet. I will post it here when it is.</p>

<p>Just a few words concerning the conference: The organizers are doing a great job here and the speakers are really good. If you’re not here, you are missing out on something :)</p>
