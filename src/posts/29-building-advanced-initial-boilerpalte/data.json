While I use HTML5 Boilerplate in nearly all of my projects it&#8217;s not enough as an initial package. Since I&#8217;m using SASS (in its dialect SCSS) and have some other things I define over and over again I decided to set up a package that lets me start easily and includes a lot of tools that are necessary for my projects. This is an introduction to init, the starting point for projects that require a bit more than just HTML5 Boilerplate.",
