Over the couse of the last month together with [Peter](https://twitter.com/sir_pepe) I worked on a tool we call [Warhol](https://warhol.io).

Warhol turns pattern libraries into test suites. It helps you to enforce a unified look and feel for your web project, no matter how large and complicated the project may be.
Warhol learns from the examples in a pattern library and supports you in implementing a truly consistent user experience.

We published a video that shows how Warhol works.
