<p class="post__intro">
  When ever I do a front-end review for webpages I start compiling a new checklist of things that I need to take into account for the review.<br>
  Now I tried to collect some of the most important questions to check for and release them publically.
</p>

Lately Google published their [Progressive Web App Checklist](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist) which made me think about which are important thinks to look after before you publish a website or shop.

The provided checklist can help you with your existing webpages and for future projects. It's also great to use it as a pre-launch checklist.

For the future I hope to extend this list with the help of the community and automate as much checks as possible to compile a comprehensive report. If you got some ideas please feel free to contribute.

If you do reviews of websites and/or find any issue with the provided list, please [contribute over at GitHub](https://github.com/drublic/checklist).

If you want to know more about about what is going wrong with your website and how this affects your users hire me for a review.
